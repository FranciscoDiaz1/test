# Lab Writeup for Buffer Overflow Project
Francisco Diaz
Due Date: December 13 2024

## Goal
The goal is to gain root access by the use of reverse shell by exploiting the buffer.

## Files Given by Professor:
- vuln.c

## Files needed to be submitted:
- Exploit.c
- Writeup.md

---

## Virtual Machine 
- **Operation System**: Ubuntu x86_64
---

## Steps Taken
### What I Did
1. **Analyzed the `vuln.c` Program**:
   I read the program file that the professor gave to us to get a better understanding how the code functioned and the best way to approach this. It was easy to understand because the professor gave us the code which he had commented and the best way to tackle this was through the  `strcpy(buffer, str); ` because it had a buffer overflow problem. In the main function it will make a large array which is bigger than the buffer which will read in from a file named "badfile" which we will create in the exploit program. This is slightly diffeent than a regular buffer overflow because the professor had asked us to do it with the use of a reverse shell. In a reverse shell it will allow the payload to allow the attacker to remotely connect to the targeted machine. This is done to the use of the payload which contains the reverse shellcode which opens a network connection. This is done by :
   - Creating a socket.
   - Connects to the attackers Ip address and port.
   - provides us with a remote shell.

## Disabling measure:
In this lab we awere asked to this in an older model which had a linux kernel of 2.4 but i was curious if i could have accomplished doing this lab with a modern linux. IN order to have the best p[ossible chance to do this i needed to disable as much of the defenses possible and I did this by typing `sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0`.

To compile the vulnerable program `vuln.c`, I used the following command:
`gcc -g -z execstack -fno-stack-protector vuln.c -o vuln` and in this lab i attempted to see the difference of trying it in both 64 and also in 32-bit. I did this by entering `gcc -g -m32 -z execstack -fno-stack-protector vuln.c -o vuln`.

### Explanation of Flags
1. **`-g`**:
   - The `-g` flag includes debugging information in the executable because without it it would not have any readable symobols while I am debugging which is needed.
   - This is important for analyzing the program with `gdb`, as it provides access to symbolic debugging data.

3. **`-z execstack`**:
   - The `-z execstack` flag enables an executable stack.
   - Modern systems often mark the stack as non-executable to prevent attacks like stack smashing which we are doing on this lab. This will allow the stack to execute code, which is necessary for executing shellcode injected during the exploit.


4. **`-fno-stack-protector`**:
   - This flag disables the stack canary, a security feature added by default to protect against buffer overflow attacks.
   - Without this flag, the program would terminate if a stack overflow is detected, making it impossible to overwrite the return address.
   - 
**Debugging Code**
     - I also used the `gdb` to examine the programâ€™s memory layout:
     - Found the buffer's starting address with `p &buffer`.
     - Located the saved base pointer with `p $rsp`. 
     - Calculated the offset to the return address with `p/d`.

2. **Constructed the Payload**:
   - Created a unique pattern manually since i was not able to use cylic pattern or pwn on my device.
   - Built a payload with:
     - A **NOP sled** to ensure reliable execution.
     - Placeholder shellcode to spawn `/bin/sh`.
     - Overwrote the return address with the calculated buffer address.

3. **Tested the Exploit**:
   - Compiled the vulnerable program and payload with:
     ```
     gcc  -fno-stack-protector -z execstack vuln.c -o vuln
     gcc  exploit.c -o exploit
     ```
   - Ran the exploit:
     ```
     ./vuln < badfile or ./vuln
     ```

### Why It Failed
- **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)**:
  - Memory addresses were randomized, making it difficult to reliably overwrite the return address.
  - ASLR was disabled during testing but could still cause issues if not fully disabled system-wide.

- **Stack Protection**:
  - The presence of `canary` values in the stack prevented the program from executing arbitrary code.
  - Stack protection was disabled during compilation, but further issues may have arisen.

---

## What I Would Do to Succeed
To perform the attack successfully:
1. **Disable All Protections**:
   - Ensure ASLR is fully disabled:
     ```
     echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
     ```
   - Verify stack protection is disabled by using `checksec` on the binary.

2. **Adjust Payload**:
   - Fine-tune the shellcode to match the target environment.
   - Use `pwntools` or similar tools to dynamically locate the buffer and return address.

3. **Use a Controlled Environment**:
   - Run the exploit in a virtual machine with all security mechanisms disabled.
